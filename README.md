# Hashing and Salting Hobby Project

This Python code repository is a hobby project created to explore the concepts of hashing and salting in Python. It demonstrates how to hash sensitive information, such as passwords, using the SHA-256 algorithm and the application of salts for added security.

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind this project is to gain a deeper understanding of cryptographic techniques used in password security. Hashing and salting are fundamental concepts in cybersecurity and are essential for protecting user credentials and sensitive data in applications.

## Functionality

- Hashing passwords using SHA-256: This code demonstrates how to generate a SHA-256 hash from a given password.
- Adding custom salts: You can provide a custom salt to enhance the security of the hashed password.
- Writing to a CSV file: The code also includes an example of how to write data (hashed passwords) to a CSV file.
